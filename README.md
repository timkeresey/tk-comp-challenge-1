## Context

This was a solo project of the first Module of Turing School of Software and Design. I completed this project over the course of 5 days. The purpose of this project was to use an HTML and CSS file to recreate the layout of a static composition provided by instructors and make it responsive.

## The Composition Template

The compostion provided included a header, a main body section, and no footer. The header has a logo graphic, a menu link, and a navigation bar with 3 navigation links.

The main body section is made up of a 4 by 2 grid of cards. The cards are made up of an image, a button, text, and a link.
